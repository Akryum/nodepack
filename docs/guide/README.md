# Overview

:::warning
Nodepack is currently in early stages of development, APIs and commands are subject to change.
:::

Nodepack is a modern node.js development platform. It can be used to create servers, backends, applications and libraries. It provides:

- A CLI to quickly create and manage projects.
- A service installed in your project which is:
  - Upgradeable;
  - Built on top of webpack, with sensible defaults;
  - Entirely configurable with config files
- A collection of official plugins integrating the best tools in the node ecosystem like Typescript and Apollo GraphQL.

The plugin system is the key strength of Nodepack. It features:

- A rich suite of public APIs from low-level stuff like webpack to high-level concepts like User Auth.
- The possibility to add, upgrade or remove plugins in a project.
- App Migrator can generate and modify your project files and rollback changes if needed.
- Environment Migrator allow your team to execute migrations or rollbacks on DBs, tools...

You can create your own plugins and publish them on NPM!
